                <h2 class="major">How Do I Know?</h2>
                <p>The process to determine if the Livermore Centennial Lightbulb is still shining is very easy with
                    modern web technologies.
                    We simply complete the following steps:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Fetch a frame from the bulbs live stream</li>
                    <li>Use a machine learning model to classify the image</li>
                    <li>Determine if a classification that implies the light bulb is still on is present</li>
                    <li>Display a simple "Yes" or "No" to the user</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Fetch A Frame</h3>
                Below is the most recent frame from the Livermore Centennial Lightbulb's live stream, and is what is
                being used to determine if the light is still on.
                <span class="image main"> <img id="streamImage"
                        src="https://livermore-lightbulb-proxy.vercel.app/api/frame" alt="MJPEG Stream"
                        crossorigin="anonymous" onload="onLoad()" class="img-fluid"></span>
                We are able to fetch this frame by using a simple proxy server that converts the MJPEG stream into a
                single image.
                This is hosted on Vercel, and is a simple Node.js server that fetches the stream and returns the most
                recent frame.
                It also adds some headers for cross origin requests, as the stream is not CORS enabled.
                This is needed to allow the machine learning model to classify the image.
                The code that drives that can be found on my github <a
                    href="https://github.com/CollinDietz/livermore-lightbulb-proxy">here</a>.
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3>Use A Machine Learning Model</h3>
                We are using a pre-trained MobileNet model from the ml5.js library to classify the image.
                This library is obtained from a CDN, and is very easy to use. We simply load the model, and then pass
                the image to it.
                The model will then return a list of classifications, and their confidence levels.
                <br>
                <br>
                For the current frame, the following classifications were returned:
                <br>
                <br>
                <table id="confidenceTable">
                    <thead>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Label</th>
                            <th>Confidence</th>
                        </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <!-- Rows will be dynamically inserted here -->
                    </tbody>
                </table>

                <h3>Determine If The Light Is Still On</h3>
                We now check if any of the classifications are ones that imply the light is still on.
                We look for "spotlight" or "spot", since these were what I saw most often while developing the website.
                The lightbulb has only been off for a few minutes ever, but testing with the saved images those
                classifications did not appear.
                Implying they will catch the bulb being off, should that ever happen. Those "off" images were taken from <a
                    href="https://www.centennialbulb.org/photos.htm#anchor1234">centennialbulb.org</a>.

                <h3>Display The Result</h3>
                Finally, we display a simple "Yes" or "No" to the user, depending on if we saw the classifications that we were looking for.
                <br>
                <br>
                For the current frame, the result is:
